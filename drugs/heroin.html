						<p>Heroin originated from Germany by the Bayer pharmaceutical company and it was sold in the market as a treatment for
							an illness, tuberculosis. It was also sold as a remedy for morphine addiction also known as the "Soldier's Disease".
							Heroin originated from Germany by the Bayer pharmaceutical company and it was sold in the market as a treatment for
							an illness, tuberculosis. Heroin is usually made from the resin; a sticky flammable organic structure that is insoluble
							in water. First removed from the pod of the poppy flower is a fluid, a sap-like opium. The opium was refined to make
							morphine and synthesize it to different kinds of heroin. The purest form of heroin looks like a fine white powder.
							It can be injected, smoked, and inhaled by snorting or sniffing.</p>

				<h1>How does Heroin affect the brain?</h1>
				<p>The heroin is converted back to morphine when it enters the brain which binds to opioid receptors. The receptors are
					located in many areas of the brain and also in the body. Heroin overdoses usually involve suppression of breathing that
					may lead to death because it affects the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain in other term, hypoxia. Hypoxia can
					have long-term psychological and neurological effects, including coma and permanent damage in the brain.
