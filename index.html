                </p>

                        <li>is often associated with knonw drug abusers</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Malnutrition.</strong> The lives of drug dependents revolve around drug abuse. They miss their
                        regular meals because they lose their appetite.</p>
                    <p><strong>Panic Reaction.</strong> The loss of thought process can cause panic reactions or feelings of
                        invulnerability. Both of these states can lead to injury and death. The prolonged harmful reactions
                        include anxiety and depressive states, or breaks with reality which may last from a few days to months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Physical Damages.</strong> In addition to those diseases which accompany the use of unsterile
                        syringes and contaminated drugs may cause certain medical problems. Liver and Kidney damage may result
                        when large quantities are taken. Many who abuse drugs also neglect personal hygiene, which can lead
                        to multiple health problems. Kindey failure, hepatits, drastic weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies
                        are some of the adverse physical complications. </p>
                    <p>The life of drug abusers is a dreadful one. To support the habit they resort to commiting crimes like
                        stealing, prostitution and gambling, which hamper their emotional maturation.
                    </p>
