                <p><strong>Malnutrition.</strong> The lives of drug dependents revolve around drug abuse. They miss their regular
                    meals because they lose their appetite.</p>
                <p><strong>Panic Reaction.</strong> The loss of thought process can cause panic reactions or feelings of invulnerability.
                    Both of these states can lead to injury and death. The prolonged harmful reactions include anxiety and
                    depressive states, or breaks with reality which may last from a few days to months.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Damages.</strong> In addition to those diseases which accompany the use of unsterile syringes
                    and contaminated drugs may cause certain medical problems. Liver and Kidney damage may result when large
                    quantities are taken. Many who abuse drugs also neglect personal hygiene, which can lead to multiple
                    health problems. Kindey failure, hepatits, drastic weight loss, and vitamin deficiencies are some of
                    the adverse physical complications. </p>
                <p>The life of drug abusers is a dreadful one. To support the habit they resort to commiting crimes like stealing,
                    prostitution and gambling, which hamper their emotional maturation.
                </p>
